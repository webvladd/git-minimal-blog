            Back during the days of the Playstation 2, the cheerful, charming
            mascot platformer was all the rage, from Spyro the Dragon to Crash
            Bandicoot, both of which have gotten remastered or remade. These
            days the cutesy platformer isn’t as popular as it once was, but
            every now and then a new one turns up and tickles the ol’ nostalgia
            balls. This time it’s Pumpkin Jack, a game that feels so much like a
            classic PS2 platformer that you could tell me it was actually just a
            remaster and I’d believe you. In fact, it’s so enamoured with
            evoking the spirit of those old platformers that it even has iffy
            combat and a naff story, just like them. So, let’s review Pumpkin
            Jack, the bastard offspring of MediEvil and A Nightmare Before
            Christmas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing to talk about is how this whole damn game was made
            by a single person over the course of 4-years. Not only is this a
            beautiful looking game thanks to it looking like it was summoned up
            from the head of Tim Burton, but it’s also remarkably polished. It
            runs great, and I only ran into two minor issues where I got stuck
            in some scenery. This is the kind of work that puts massive triple-A
            studios to shame, although in fairness Pumpkin Jack is also a much
            smaller project.

          <p>
            So, how does one become a walking, talking pumpkin called Jack?
            Turns out things have been far too nice and peaceful and happy, so
            the Devil decides to invade the boring kingdom of, er, Boring, and
            spice things up a bit. But even the Devil can encounter problems,
            and in this case the problem is a pesky human wizard who might be
            able to stop the demonic assault using a mystical amulet and the
            power of plot contrivance. And so the Devil decides to dispatch his
            own champion, none other than Jack, known for tricking the Devil
            when he was alive not once, not twice, but three times. Jack’s soul
            gets shoved into a pumpkin and he is given a body, and directed to
            stop the wizard. That includes ripping through the various beasties
            because in their mindless frenzy there’s no friend or foe, just
            victims.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the absurd premise, Pumpkin Jack isn’t as funny as I thought,
            and indeed hoped, it would be. That isn’t to say it’s some sort of
            grim portrayal of the end of the world, either. It’s more just
            mildly amusing with a few decent jokes stemming from Jack’s own
            snarky personality and his continuing annoyance with characters that
            need favours. Overall, I’d have to say that the writing is probably
            one of the two weakest aspects of Pumpkin Jack. It gets the job
            done, there’s a couple of funny moments and that’s about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But while the story might not hit it out of the park, I do love that
            we get to play as the bad guy in Pumpkin Jack. Sure, aside from the
            whole dooming the world thing you don’t do anything properly evil
            like murder a bunch of humans or kick a baby, but it’s still fun to
            just be the bad guy trying to help end the world.

          <p>
            Maybe I’m completely wrong, but Pumpkin Jack feels a lot like it
            takes many cues from MediEvil, a series which made a comeback in
            remastered form earlier this year. Check my review for that out, why
            don’t you? The point is, the same fantastical tone of Sir Daniel
            Fortesque’s adventure is prevalent throughout Pumpkin Jack.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of your time is spent leaping and climbing. Right from the
            start Jack can double-jump and…no, that’s it actually. This is your
            classic platforming action, albeit much easier than the likes of
            Crash Bandicoot. You’ll rarely, if ever, die while you leap and
            clamber. That’s partially because the controls feel great. Jack
            isn’t very controllable in the air, but on the ground you can easily
            line up jumps and be confident about where you’ll end up before you
            ever tap the button. Over the course of the game, though, the
            platforming never really changes. It’s the same basic jumps over and
            over.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mentioned earlier that Pumpkin Jack truly evokes the feel of the
            PS2 platformers by having a forgettable story and meh combat, so
            let’s talk about that combat. You have three buttons: one that you
            mash to attack, another that sends out your crow companion for a
            ranged attack, and a dodge. Getting into a fight with skeletons,
            ghouls, rats and other weird beasts is nothing more than a
            button-mashing festival with the occasional dodge thrown in for good
            measure. The only thing that changes is the amount of enemies that
            get thrown at you, and the enemies themselves. You’ll battle
            possessed Christmas trees, invisible knights and more. It’s a solid
            selection of foes to slay, but I never really looked forward to a
            fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            The boss battles are different. While they don’t exactly thrown the
            design book at a passing child, they’re well enough executed and
            visually fun enough that you probably won’t care you’re doing the
            typical things like jumping over ground pound attacks. Plus, beating
            up the bosses that bookend every level means getting your hands on a
            new weapon. These don’t change the combat much, with the exception
            of the blunderbuss which naturally gives you a bit more range.
            You’re free to swap between weapons whenever you like. Personally, I
            quite enjoyed the talking sword that also makes Jack levitate.

          <p>
            Aside from the platforming and the massacring of anything in the
            way, there are a couple of other things thrown into the mix. Each
            level typically contains an on-rail segment that feels so much
            something ripped straight out of the Playstation 2 era that I
            briefly thought I’d travelled back in time and was going to wind up
            accidentally flirting with my mum or something. You’ll ride on
            minecarts, a spooky horse and more, using the jump button and your
            crow companion to break objects. These sections are fun at first,
            but I did find that having them pop up every level was a bit much.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pumpkin Jack has more success with some of its other gameplay
            mechanics. Riding the boat of the dead, for instance, is pretty cool
            as it travels through walls and other objects, leaving you to leap
            across some gaps in order to get back to the boat. Jack also has the
            handy, albeit freaky, ability to detach his head and then use
            tentacles to crawl about like something out of a Hentai video you
            found after spending too long on PornHub. This little sections are
            used for some daft little mini-games, including pairing up graves
            with some very familiar names and even a strange battle against
            Santa Claus. These are a mixed bag but also add some great variety
            to the mix, helping the short 4-6 hour completion time whizz by.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I did say just 4-6 hours. Personally, I wrapped the game up in
            4-hours, but I didn’t grab every skull and unlocked every costume,
            nor did I seek out all the gramophones hidden around the beautiful
            levels. If you’re the kind of person who feels like they need a lot
            of hours of playtime for their money, Pumpkin Jack ain’t for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pumpkin Jack’s best strength and its biggest weakness is how light
            and breezy it is. On the one hand, it’s such as easy game to play
            and unwind with, the kind that you can fire up at any point despite
            the mood you’re in and have a good time. But on the other hand, that
            same simplicity is a curse because Pumpkin Jack feels lightweight
            and shallow. It’s combat and platforming never really change from
            the opening minutes to the credits, which is why the short running
            time is a boon. Any longer and Pumpkin Jack would need some new
            tricks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Scattered around the levels like disguisting candy are Crow Skulls
            which you can exchange for new skins for Jack to wear. There’s about
            five or six different skins, including a detective and a samurai, so
            the collection isn’t vast, but each one looks great and they make
            picking through the levels feel worthwhile. In 2020, skins are
            usually sold to us for real cash, so it’s awesome to see Pumpkin
            Jack stick to its oldschool guns and just give them to you for
            playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pumpkin Jack is a project borne of love and it shows in every
            gorgeous scene and in how it pays adoring homage to the platformers
            of yesteryear. While part of me wishes it tried to be more than the
            PS2 era platformers it imitates and evolved its gameplay over the
            course of its story, Pumpkin Jack is nevertheless a fun time. So, if
            you’re looking for a trip down memory lane to simpler times where
            Jack & Dexter, Spyro and Crash were all the rage, Pumpkin Jack is a
            damn fine choice.
